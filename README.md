This application requires [CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) to be setup and installed to play audio through your microphone (Be sure to set CABLE as the default microphone for Windows or any application you plan on using the soundboard with). The program will automatically detect the first instance of CABLE as the input device.
